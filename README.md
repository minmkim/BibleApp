# Mt. Zion (Bible)

This app is a work in progress. Currently it uses the 1984 NIV translation and allows the user to read, save, and search. Search is limited to specific verses and words. The app also includes a custom siri shortcut to search for verses and get their text.

I am currently working to improve the saved verse screen to allow for note taking and quick save of verses.
